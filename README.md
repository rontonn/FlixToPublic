As you can see from my GitHub I’ve never posted here any commercial code and I’m really disappointed that I have to do it now.
On this project, I was working for 5 months, from October 2021 to the 21st of February.
I’ve been paid for my job during the first 3 months. For January and February, I didn’t get the payment.

Julian Voll is one of the CEOs of Privi Chain Inc. I’ve spent 2 months discussing with him this problem and was been receiving false promises. 

Julian broke the agreement and NDA because he didn’t pay me for the job I’ve done. 
Be aware of such behavior from your partners and employers.
So I think it would be fair that any developer can access this code and use something from it.
